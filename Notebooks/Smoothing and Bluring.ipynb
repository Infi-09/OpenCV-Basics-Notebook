    "# Smoothing and Blurring\n",
    "I’m pretty sure we all know what blurring is. It’s what happens when your camera takes a picture out of focus. Sharper regions in the image lose their detail, normally as a disc/circular shape.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
    "Practically, this means that each pixel in the image is mixed in with its surrounding pixel intensities. This “mixture” of pixels in a neighborhood becomes our blurred pixel.While this effect is usually unwanted in our photographs,it’s actually quite helpful when performing image processing tasks.                            \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, many image processing and computer vision functions, such as thresholding and edge detection, perform better if the image is first smoothed or blurred."
