    "We then apply adaptive thresholding to our blurred image using the cv2.adaptiveThreshold function The first parameter we supply is the image we want to threshold. Then, we supply our maximum value of 255, similar to simple thresholding mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third argument is our method to compute the threshold for the current neighborhood of pixels. By supplying cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C, we indicate that we want to compute the mean of the neighborhood of pixels and treatit as our T value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need our thresholding method. Again, the description of this parameter is identical to the simple thresholding method mentioned above. We use cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV to indicate that any pixel intensity greater than T inthe neighborhood should be set to 255, otherwise it should\n",
    "be set to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next parameter is our neighborhood size. This integer value must be odd and indicates how large our neighborhood of pixels is going to be. We supply a value of 11, indicating that we are going to examine 11 × 11 pixel regions of the image, instead of trying to threshold the image globally, as in simple thresholding methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we supply a parameter simply called C. This value is an integer that is subtracted from the mean, allowing us to fine-tune our thresholding. We use C = 4 in this example. The results of applying mean weighted adaptive thresholding can be seen in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides applying standard mean thresholding, we can also apply Gaussian (weighted mean) thresholding. The order of the parameters are identical to adaptive threshold mean , but now we are tuning a few of the values. Instead of supplying a value of cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_ MEAN_C, we instead use cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C to indicate we want to use the weighted mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also using a 15 × 15 pixel neighborhood size rather than an 11 × 11 neighborhood size as in the previous example. We also alter our C value (the value we subtract from the mean) slightly and use 3 rather than 4. The results of applying Gaussian adaptive thresholding and mean adaptive thresholding has a little difference between the two images.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, choosing between mean adaptive thresholding and Gaussian adaptive thresholding requires a few experiments on your end. The most important parameters to vary are the neighborhood size and C, the value you subtract from the mean. By experimenting with this value, you will be able to dramatically change the results of your thresholding."
